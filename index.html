  <h1>TV Talks With Ibrahim</h1>
  <p>Let's talk about some of my favourite TV shows I have watched over the past few years and why I think it should be on your watchlist if you have nothing interesting to watch or you are scrolling through Netflix for a long time whilst your pasta is getting cold.</p>

  <h2>Game of Thrones</h2>
  <p>Now unless you were living under a rock for the past decade, I'm sure you've seen or heard about this show. Game of Thrones is the first series I binge watched and boy am I glad I did. 
    No show has ever had a hold on me like this one, from the characters, the plot, the score, the fighting sequences etc. There was a lot of questions when the show was announced due to the global success of the books by George RR Martin but the HBO show gained popularity and quickly became one of the most watched shows of television.
    Have to say though, it is definately a <strong>18 rated</strong> show (yep, double what you're thinking) but I'm a fan of fictional gory and violence.
    Now, this show did unfortunately end in a very dreadful ending with seasons 7 & 8, but the prime seasons is what made the show for me. So if you like dragons, violence and gore, then this is the show for you. 
    Just a heads up, <strong>do not</strong> get attatched to any characters for your own good.</p>

  <h2>Breaking Bad</h2>
  <p>Here is another popular show which you must have heard of, Breaking Bad. To put it simply, it is about a chemist teacher who partners up with one of his old students to create crystal meth. The show does start off slowly as we get introduced to characters and the plot so you will have to endure the first season and a half.
    But once the show gets going, it does not stop till the end.
    You will see one of the most greatest television performances by Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul as they picked up academy awards for their roles in the show. Giancarlo Esposito, who plays Gus Fring, executes the perfect menacing drug lord role.</p>

  <h2>Mr.Robot</h2>
  <p>I would say this is one of the most underrated shows out there right now and it should definately be talked about more. Mr Robot is about Elliot, a cyber-security engineer during the day and a vigilante hacker during the night. 
  He is recruited by <em>"Mr.Robot"</em> who is the leader of a hacker group to take down the worlds largest conglomerate. The star of the show is Rami Malek who showcases his talent and there are many breath-taking moments in the show and multiple twists which will have you shocked.</p>

  <h2>True Detective</h2>
  <p>Another underrated HBO show which released back in 2014. The show is about 2 detectives played by Matthew McConaghey and Woody Harrelson investigate homicides around the USA and are forced to face dark secrets about themselves and the people around them. If you like mystery, thriller and crime then this is perfect for you.
    Rust Cohle, played by McConaughey, is easily in my top 3 of TV protagonists and it is no wonder why he picked up a Critics Choice Award for his performance. Every episode had been at the edge of my seat and just the dialogue and the settings of the show was so intriguing. True Detective currently has 3 seasons, with every season having a fresh plot and set of characters but the first season is a gold mine compared to the rest.</p>

  <h2>The Last Of Us</h2>
  <p>So this show just released earlier this year on HBO and it is gaining a lot of attraction worldwide. It is about a man named Joel smuggling a 14 year old girl names Ellie accross the US create a vaccine in a post-apocalyptic world.
    They face many difficulties along the way with armed terrorist groups and the <em>'infected'</em>. This show is based off the critically acclaimed video game, The Last Of Us which released on Playstation 3 back in 2013. I can't lie, I am being a little bit biased as I played the game a decade ago and love and follow anything related to it.
    I was so nervous about the show not doing the game justice but so far, they have exceeded my expectations. Joel is played by Pedro Pascal and Ellie is played by Bella Ramsey.</p>
